# automerge-repo-network-peerjs

A network adapter for [automerge-repo](https://github.com/automerge/automerge-repo) for WebRTC (P2P), based on [MessageChannelNetworkAdapter](https://github.com/automerge/automerge-repo/blob/main/packages/automerge-repo-network-messagechannel/src/index.ts) (point-to-point).

**NOTE:** This is not an official part of the automerge-repo project, rather a community contribution that includes a dependency on the [peerjs](https://github.com/peers/peerjs) library.
